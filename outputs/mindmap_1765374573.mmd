  root((Degree of Saturation (S)))
    Definition
      Proportion of void space filled with water
      Expressed as a percentage
    Formula
      S = (V_w / V_v) × 100%
        V_w: Volume of water
        V_v: Total volume of voids
    Interpretation
      S = 0%
        Completely dry soil
      S = 100%
        Fully saturated soil
      0% < S < 100%
        Partially saturated soil
    Significance in Geotechnical Engineering
      Influences shear strength
      Affects permeability
      Impacts compressibility
      Related to frost action susceptibility
